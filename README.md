This project was created to demonstrate my skills in software development. In the core this web apps feature should be a social media like plattform to generate AI generated Images, like and comment them. Till i can implement this AI stuff, i have to focus on some fundamental parts.

Here is a list of Features already implemented:
- Prisma as ORM
- Tailwind CSS

Next Features:
- Redux.js
- Sessions and Authentication
- API calls need Authentication
- IT Security
- logging ( i want to log login activity without personal data and catch all errors and write them in the database as well as sending me an email notification )
- automated testing for all features
